  A fast FASTQ filter program
  
  This program can apply one or multiple filters on FASTQ files. It works 
  on plain FASTQ files as well as on compressed (fastq.gz) files.
  
  Currently available filters:
    - Minimum length
    - Maximum length
    - Average error rate
    - Mean quality
    - Median quality (deprecated)
 
  Fastq-filter correctly takes into account that quality scores are log scores
  when calculating the mean. 

  Fastq-filter contains several optimizations so it can filter reasonably 
  fast. See the homepage for more details.
  
  Bugs in the galaxy wrapper can also be reported on the tool's github 
  repository. The galaxy wrapper is hosted in the same repository.
